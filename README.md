# Fake Feedback App

This is a simple "feedback" application made for practice some react fundamentals.

## How to start this piece of garbage?

1) `npm install` or `npm i` to install all dependencies
2) `npm run server` to start json-server with some fake api and db
3) `npm start` to start app itself
